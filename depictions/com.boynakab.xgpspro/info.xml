		Fake GPS is an app with which you can change your iPhone/iPad's current location as you wish. After setting a fake location with just a long press on a map view, all location-based apps(like Facebook, Twitter, Line, Wechat, etc) on your device immediately believe you are there.<br/>
		It is really a perfectly match for Facebook, Twitter, Line and other location-based apps. By changing your location, you can:<br/>
		1. Protect your location privacy from people on SNS sites.<br/>
		2. Get around the location specific locks that some apps put in place to prevent you from viewing content in certain regions.<br/>
		3. Go where you've never been before, and meet people there, in a second.<br/>
		Configure from XGPS app.
